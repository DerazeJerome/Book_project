Judging a book on its cover


This project was a 2-months project, made during a data science formation.

The objective was to re-edit state of the art and go further in deep learning development.

We used pre-trained inception CNN to elaborate 2 different models, and we combine them with a Text Mining model.

You can use the program, see our statistics in every categories and test it with jpeg images.

IMPORTANT : You have to download pre_trained_models folder content to run the program. Please read comments at the head of the program.
